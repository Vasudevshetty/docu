- `src/infrastructure/storage/FileSystemAdapter.ts` - Added bookmark database path method

### New Services

- `src/services/BookmarkService.ts` - High-level bookmark management operations

### New CLI Commands

- `src/cli/bookmark.ts` - Complete bookmark command suite

### Integration Points

- `bin/index.ts` - Added bookmark command to main CLI
- `src/cli/search.ts` - Added bookmark suggestion option

### Tests & Documentation

- `tests/bookmark.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite
- `README.md` - Updated with bookmark feature documentation
- `demo-bookmarks.sh` - Demo script showing bookmark capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Bookmarks table with rich metadata
CREATE TABLE bookmarks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  docset TEXT NOT NULL,
  url TEXT,
  tags TEXT, -- JSON array
  notes TEXT,
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  importance TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
  snippet TEXT,
  search_query TEXT
);

-- Full-text search index
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE bookmarks_fts USING fts5(
  id, title, content, notes, tags, category, docset
);
```

### Command Interface

```bash
# Core bookmark operations
docu bookmark add <query> [options]     # Add bookmark from search
docu bookmark list [filters]            # List bookmarks with filters
docu bookmark search <query>            # Search through bookmarks
docu bookmark remove <id>               # Remove bookmark
docu bookmark stats                     # Show usage statistics

# Advanced features
docu bookmark add "query" --interactive # Choose from multiple results
docu bookmark add "query" --notes "..." --tags "tag1,tag2" --importance high
docu bookmark list --docset react --tag hooks --limit 10
docu bookmark search "state management" --pager
```

### Smart Features

1. **Auto-categorization**: Maps docsets to logical categories
2. **Tag suggestion**: Analyzes content to suggest relevant tags
3. **Search integration**: Seamlessly bookmark results from regular searches
4. **Importance scoring**: Three-level system with visual indicators

## üí° Value Propositions

### For Individual Developers

- **Faster Learning**: Build personal reference collection of key concepts
- **Reduced Context Switching**: Quick access to previously found solutions
- **Knowledge Retention**: Personal notes enhance understanding and recall
- **Pattern Recognition**: Analytics help identify learning focus areas

### For Teams

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Export/import bookmark collections (future enhancement)
- **Onboarding**: Senior developers can share curated learning paths
- **Best Practices**: Bookmark and share recommended patterns and approaches

### For Organizations

- **Productivity Gains**: Reduced time spent re-searching for solutions
- **Knowledge Management**: Structured approach to documentation consumption
- **Learning Analytics**: Insights into team's learning patterns and needs

## üéØ User Experience Improvements

### Before Bookmarking

1. Search for information
2. Find relevant result
3. **Forget where it was found**
4. **Re-search same information later**
5. **Lose time and context**

### After Bookmarking

1. Search for information
2. Find relevant result
3. **Bookmark with personal notes**
4. **Quick retrieval anytime**
5. **Build personal knowledge base**

## üìä Expected Usage Patterns

### Daily Workflow Integration

```bash
# Morning: Check recent bookmarks for context
docu bookmark list --recent --limit 5

# During development: Search and bookmark solutions
docu search "react error boundaries" --bookmark
docu bookmark add "error boundaries" --notes "Use for production error handling"

# End of day: Review and organize bookmarks
docu bookmark stats
docu bookmark list --tag "to-review"
```

### Learning Sessions

```bash
# Learning React hooks
docu bookmark add "useState" --importance high --notes "Basic state management"
docu bookmark add "useEffect" --importance high --notes "Side effects and cleanup"
docu bookmark add "useContext" --importance medium --notes "For avoiding prop drilling"

# Later review
docu bookmark search "react hooks"
docu bookmark list --tag react --category "Frontend Framework"
```
